.SH NAME
bic - simple arbitrary-precision calculator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bic
.RB [ -h ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A simple calculator program that handles arbitrarily-large numbers.
It's similar to the standard "bc" calculator, but can handle larger
numbers, goes somewhat faster, and has some more special functions.
However unlike "bc" it does not handle fractional numbers, only integers.
It also does not implement bc's booleans, bit operations, functions, etc.
It doesn't implement general base-changing only hexadecimal via the -h flag.
It does implement variables and assignments, but they can only be
one letter long.
.PP
The basic operations are the usual ones with the usual precedence,
plus a couple extra:
.IP "x + y"
addition
.IP "x - y"
subtraction
.IP "x * y"
multiplication
.IP "x / y"
division
.IP "x % y"
remainder
.IP "-x"
unary negation
.IP "x ^ y"
exponentiation
.IP "x!"
factorial
.PP
You can use parentheses to group sub-expressions.
Then there are the special functions:
.IP "sqrt( x )"
square root
.IP "gcd( x, y )"
greatest common divisor
.IP "lcm( x, y )"
least common multiple
.IP "modpow( x, y, z )"
modular exponentiation - equivalent to ( x ^ y ) % z, but much faster
.IP "modinv( x, y )"
modular inverse
.IP "random( x )"
random number in [0..x)
.IP "bits( x )"
number of bits in x
.IP "digits( x )"
number of digits in x, approximately
.IP "jacobi( x, y )"
the Jacobi symbol
.IP "isprime( x, y )"
check whether x is a prime number, to certainty y
.IP "genprime( x, y )"
generate a probable prime number x bits long, with certainty y
.PP
For the last two functions, the certainty just specifies how many times
to run the probabilistic prime check.
A 0 return means the number is definitely not prime.
A 1 return means the number is probably prime, with an error probability
of less than 1/4 ^ certainty.
Note: in fact the error probability is much lower, that's just a
theoretical bound.
Using a certainty of 1 gives a theoretical error probability of 0.25, but
in fact a large number that passes such a test is almost certainly prime.
Using certainty more than, say, 5 is huge overkill.
See "Finding Four Million Large Random Primes", Ronald Rivest, Advances
in Cryptology: Proceedings of Crypto '91 - he estimates the chance of
a 512-bit number falsely passing a single test at 10^-44.
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Here's how you could use bic to do an RSA encryption and decryption.
.PP
First, decide how many bits long you want your keys to be.
Let's say 500.
Generate two prime numbers half that long (takes a couple seconds each):
.nf
    p = genprime(250,4)
    q = genprime(250,4)
.fi
Compute their product, and the product of one less than the primes:
.nf
    n = p * q
    o = (p-1) * (q-1)
.fi
Pick a public key - a random number less than o:
.nf
    e = random(o)
.fi
Compute the corresponding private key:
.nf
    d = modinv(e,o)
.fi
If this step fails (due to e not being relatively prime to o), pick another e.
It may take a few tries.
.PP
Now you have your public and private keys.
Pick a message to encrypt, up to 500 bits long:
.nf
    m = 12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
.fi
Encrypt it with your public key (this takes a few seconds):
.nf
    c = modpow(m,e,n)
.fi
Decrypt it with your private key (also takes a few seconds):
.nf
    modpow(c,d,n)
    12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
.fi
That's all there is to it!
