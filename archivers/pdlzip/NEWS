Changes in version 1.7:

The option "-a, --trailing-error", which makes pdlzip exit with error
status 2 if any remaining input is detected after decompressing the last
member, has been added.

When decompressing, the file specified with the '--output' option is now
deleted if the input is a terminal.

A harmless check failure on Windows, caused by the failed comparison of
a message in text mode, has been fixed.
