.SH NAME
pdlzip \- reduces the size of files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdlzip
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,files\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pdlzip \- A permissively licensed implementation of the lzip data
compressor also able to decompress legacy lzma\-alone (.lzma) files.
.PP
Lzma\-alone is a very bad format; it is essentially a raw LZMA stream.
If you keep any lzma\-alone files, it is advisable to recompress them to
lzip format. Lziprecover can convert lzma\-alone files to lzip format
without recompressing.

.PP
If no file names are given, or if a file is '\-', pdlzip compresses or
decompresses from standard input to standard output.
Numbers may be followed by a multiplier: k = kB = 10^3 = 1000,
Ki = KiB = 2^10 = 1024, M = 10^6, Mi = 2^20, G = 10^9, Gi = 2^30, etc...
Dictionary sizes 12 to 27 are interpreted as powers of two, meaning 2^12
to 2^27 bytes.
.PP
The bidimensional parameter space of LZMA can't be mapped to a linear
scale optimal for all files. If your files are large, very repetitive,
etc, you may need to use the \fB\-\-dictionary\-size\fR and \fB\-\-match\-length\fR
options directly to achieve optimal performance. For example, \fB\-9m64\fR
usually compresses executables more (and faster) than \fB\-9\fR.
.PP
Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file
not found, invalid flags, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or
invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency error (eg, bug) which
caused pdlzip to panic.
