What, why?
----------

This is an implementation of John Conway's game of life, made with C and Curses
library. The purpose was to practice C, but I ended up making an interface with
curses and at the same time practicing it.

Any comments, modifications and stuff are welcome as long as they are
constructive :)

Controls
--------

h = move left
j = move down
k = move up
l = move right
Spacebar = make cell alive
Up arrow = increase the number of generations per run
Down arrow = decrease the number of generations per run
q = quit
Enter = begin simulation

Use the hjkl, spacebar, up arrow, and down arrow keys to move around the grid, activate cells, and determine how many generations your simulation will last. Then press Enter to run the simulation. You can repeat the process after the simulation finishes.
