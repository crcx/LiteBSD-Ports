Type "make" to build the starlanes binaries, then "make fakeinstall"
which will, uh, pretend to install everything.  If all the commands that
it's going to execute look correct, go ahead and type "make install" (as
root) to install the goods.

Sorry about the one big source, but it's only a game.  :-)

This is a port to C from a version of Starlanes for the Osborne 1.  The
original source is from a First Osborne Group (FOG) disk that I probably
picked up in 1982.  The author isn't identified.  Based on comments in
a TRS-80 version I picked up off the web, it would appear that it was
first published in Creative Computing magazine.
