# I like to add these CFLAGS and LDFLAGS as I find
# you often save 15K-30K per program with them.
# Stripping the final binaries also brings down the size a lot.
CFLAGS+= -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections

# If you need to link to libraries other than libc and libgcc.
LDADD+= -lm -lncurses

# If you set PROG, then you get automagic building and installation,
# as if it were any other program in the main tree. You can delete
# eveything from here on down, except for the .include <bsd.port.mk>
# line.
# If you do not set PROG, you need to install the port by hand.
# This is easy: the magic target name is beforeinstall.
# XXX: Make a better target name, like do-install
# You can also use the beforeinstall target with automagic
# installation to install necessary items that are not binaries or
# manual pages, such as READMEs or run-time configuration files.
beforeinstall:
	install -d ${DESTDIR}${BINDIR}
	install -d ${DESTDIR}${MANDIR}1
	install -c -m 555 myprogram ${DESTDIR}${BINDIR}
	install -c -m 444 myprogram.0 ${DESTDIR}${MANDIR}1

.include <bsd.port.mk>	# Do not delete this!
